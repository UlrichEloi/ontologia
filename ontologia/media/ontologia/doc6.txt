Plant Structure and Growth
Plant body divided into root and
shoot
Shoot consists of leaves, buds,
flowers, and stem
Root consists of primary and
secondary (lateral) roots
Growth occurs at meristems
Apical meristems of root and
shoot allow for increase in
length - primary growth
lateral meristems allow for
increase in girth (diameter) -
secondary growthPlant growth
Primary growth occurs at root and shoot apical meristemsRoot apical meristem is covered by protective root capApical meristems give rise to
primary tissues:
protoderm- gives rise to epidermis
procambium - gives rise to
primary vascular tissue
(primary xylem and phloem)
ground meristem - gives rise to
parenchyma
Lateral meristems produce secondary
growth:
cork cambium - produces cork
cells of outer bark
vascular cambium - produces
secondary vascular tissue
(secondary xylem and phloem)Plant tissue types
ground tissue - thin walled parenchyma cells in interior of root and
shoot - which function in storage, photosynthesis, and secretion
often capable of giving rise to other tissue types
dermal tissue - covers entire plant body (more detail later)
vascular tissue -
xylem - for conducting water and dissolved minerals
phloem - for conducting carbohydrates and other substances
necessary for plant growthSecondary growth - only
possible in woody plants
produced by lateral meristems
vascular cambium produces
secondary xylem to the
interior of the stem and
secondary phloem to the
outside of the stem
cork cambium produces cork
cells of bark as diameter
increasesDermal tissue
epidermal cells originate from protoderm - covered by waxy cuticle
in green shoots, young roots, and leaves
specialized cells in the epidermis include guard cells and trichomes
root hairs are extensions of individual epidermal cellsGround tissue
Parenchyma - irregularly shaped thin walled living cells that fill much
of the interior of a root, shoot, or fruit
Collenchyma - elongate living cells with thickened walls provide
support for plant organs like leaves and stems without secondary
growth - e.g. strings in celery
Sclerenchyma - usually nonliving cells - cell walls reinforced with
lignin
fibers - long slender cells grouped together into strands that
provide support - e.g. linen fibers from flax
addition of fibers to wood makes wood “hardwood”
sclerids - irregular shaped cells found in groups and serve to
strengthen and protect - e.g. grit of pearsVascular tissue
Xylem : tracheids and vessel elements - both dead cells, lacking
cytoplasm, attached end to end, for water and mineral transport
tracheids are found in all vascular plants, vessels are only
common in angiosperms
vessels are more efficient conductorsVascular tissue
Phloem: consists of sieve tubes and companion cells, for transport of
carbohydrates from areas of photosynthesis
Sieve tubes have cytoplasm, and cell membrane, but lack a nucleus,
and are maintained by companion cells (modified parenchyma cells)
Sieve tube elements connected through sieve plateRoot structure:
Developing roots have four regions
Root cap - parenchyma cells that
cover and protect tip of young rootsecretes mucilaginous substance, also
functions to perceive gravity
Zone of cell division - root apical
meristem - dome of cells at center of
root tip can divide every 12 to 36
hours, gives rise to protoderm,
procambium and ground meristem
Zone of elongation - Cells become longer than wide by expansion
of vacuoles, no further increase in cell size afterwards
Zone of maturation - cells differentiate into specific cell typesRoot structure:
epidermal cells can develop root hairs as outgrowths
cortex - parenchyma cells that can function in food storage
endodermis - single layer of cells with cell walls impregnated with
suberin - prevents water and mineral passage between cells -
suberin band around cells is the “Casparian strip”
Stele - all cells interior to the endodermis
Pericycle - parenchyma just interior to the endodermis - can produce
lateral roots and the root vascular cambiumDicot roots have central core of primary xylem, arms radiate
toward pericycle and phloem between arms
Monocot xylem forms ring of vascular bundles surrounding
central cylinder of pith
Dicot MonocotRoot modifications
Adventitious roots - arise along stem or locations other than base
of plant
Aerial roots - roots that extend out into the air, unconnected to the
ground
Prop roots - located on lower part of stem of some monocots like
corn, grow down into ground, anchor against wind
Pneumatophores - spongy outgrowths from underwater roots
May extend above water, increase oxygen supply to roots
Parasitic roots - penetrate host plants to parasitize them
Food storage roots - branch roots of plants like sweet potatoes
produce extra parenchyma cells for carbohydrate storage
Buttress roots - produced by certain varieties of fig and tropical
trees for supportStem structure:
Node - the region of leaf attachment
Internode - stem area between nodes
Leaves project from stem
Blade: Flattened portion
Petiole: Slender stalk supporting
blade
Axil - angle formed by leaf
attachment to the stem
Axillary bud is produced in
each axil
Axillary buds may develop
into branches
Terminal bud - produced at tip
of stem
Terminal buds extend length
of stemDicot stems have vascular bundles arranged in ring around a core
of pith - with primary xylem to the inside and primary phloem to
the outside - vascular cambium is found between xylem and
phloem
Monocot stems have vascular bundles scattered throughout
ground tissue - have no vascular cambium - so secondary growth
is not possibleSecondary growth
Vascular cambium produces secondary xylem to inside and
secondary phloem to outside
secondary xylem is wood and is added in sequential layers
phloem is thin-walled and is older layers are crushed as new
layers are produced and stem increases in girth
Cork cambium arises in cortex and produces new cork to outsideModified stemsLeaf structureLeaf cellular structure
Upper and lower epidermis covered by waxy cuticle
Epidermal cells are nonphotosynthetic except for guard cells that
surround stomata
Interior cells are called mesophyll cells and are photosynthetic
palisade mesophyll tightly packed under upper epidermis
spongy mesophyll composed of loose cells above lower epidermisStomate and Guard Cells:
Two guard cells surround the stomate
cell wall thickened along stomate border - allows opening
and closing of stomate with change in cell volumeModified leaves
Floral leaves (bracts) - brightly colored leaves that surround
flowers and add to ability to attract pollinators -
e.g. Poinsettias, flowering dogwood
Spines - reduce water loss and protect against predators - e.g. cactus
Reproductive leaves - leaves that form new plantlets and allow for
asexual reproduction - e.g. Kalanchoe (AKA “leaf of life”)
Insectivorous leaves - leaves that
trap insects in order to
digest and extract minerals
that are in short supply
otherwise - e.g. pitcher
plants, Venus flytrap, and
sundew
