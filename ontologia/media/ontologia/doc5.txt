Plant Anatomy
= the study of plant cell and tissue structurePlant cell structure
“Cell” - originally coined by Robert Hooke, in
1600’s.
Cell theory:
1) All life made of cells
2) Cells arise from pre-existing cells
3) Cells units of metabolism
4) Cells contain complete DNA, hereditary
substance.Cell structureErgastic substances
= by-products of metabolism
amyloplasts - starch grains
= polymer of alpha-glucose2 forms of
glucoseErgastic substances
chromoplasts - pigmented bodies, composed of
carotenoids (e.g., carotene); cause red/orange
coloration.carotene
when hydrolysed, yields two vitamin A
molecules:
carotene ---> vitamin A + vitamin A
function in plants is pigmentation, howevercarotene
2 vitamin A
+ 2 H2OErgastic substances
crystals - calcium oxalate (e.g., raphides/druses) or silica
- waste/metabolic products or protective
(deter herbivory)
raphides druseErgastic substances
aleurone grains - protein (storage)
tannins - phenol derivatives (deter herbivory,
deter infection)
fats, oils, waxes - tri-/di-glyerides (storage,
secretion)Cell structure
Cell wall
Primary (1°) cell wall
Formed during growth/expansion of cells
Made up mainly of cellulose
= polymer of beta-glucose units
Plasmodesmata
Holes in 1° cell wall, allow for cell to cell
communicationcell wall:
cellulosic
plasmodesmatacellulose:
beta form
of glucoseCellulosic cell wall
made of cellulose microfibrilsCell structure
Cell wall
Secondary (2°) cell wall
Formed after growth/expansion of cells,
inside original primary cell wall
Made up mainly of lignin
= polymer of phenolic units
hard subtance
Pits - holes in secondary cell walllignin - secondary cell wallSecretory cells
laticifers - cells that secrete latex,
containing isoprenes (e.g., rubber)
glandular trichomes, oil ducts -
secrete oilsPlant growth
Meristems - actively growing regions of plant
Primary meristems
Root apical meristems
Shoot apical meristems
Meristems
- cell division
- cell elongation

Results in different cell and tissue types
Tissue = 1 or more cell types having a
common origin or functionEpidermal cell
- outer layer of all plant organs
- in land plants, protected by outer cuticle
- cuticle helps to prevent dessicationcuticle - protective layer on outside
- helps prevent water lossparenchyma
• - living at maturity
• - involved in metabolic reactionsparenchyma
nucleuscollenchyma
• - cells living, elongate
• - cell walls unevenly thickened,
rich in pectins [pectin - complex polysaccaride,
mainly of galacturonic acid units]
• - functions in structural support
(while stem is still elongating)collenchyma
pectic-rich
cell wallssclerenchyma
- cells dead at maturity
- thick, secondary, lignified cell walls
- functions in structural support
2 cell types:
fibers - very long, thin, tapered
sclereids - variable in shape, mostly isodiametric2° cell wall

• -function: conduction of water and minerals
• -consists of:
– parenchyma
– fibers
– tracheary elements (2 types: tracheids and vessels)

-function: conduction of sugars
-consists of:
parenchyma
fibers
sieve elements (2 types: sieve cells or sieve tube members)
- actual sugar-conductive cells
- semi-live at maturity (lose nuclei, but have cytoplasm)
- primary cell-wall only
- have callose-lined pores (making up a sieve plate or
sieve area), through which sugar sol. passessieve plate

memberPlant organs
root - absorptive, anchoring, storage organ
shoot = stem + associated leaves
stem - conductive, supportive, storage organ
leaf - photosynthetic organ
bud = immature shoot, gen. arising from leaf
axile; ---> lateral branchroot cap
root apical
ROOT (l.s.) meristem
1) Protective root cap
2) Absorptive root hairsROOT (c.s.)
3) Give rise to new roots endogenously
